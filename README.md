# Challenge_6-WeatherPy Vacation
The objective of this challenge was to create a relatively short travel-distance itineray map that includes the temperature preferences of the travelers, locations,
hotels and current weather conditions using application programming interfaces, or APIs. APIs allow for the interaction of multiple programs, thus you can obtain a lot
of specific pieces of information relatively fast. In here, I created a database of different locations, using randomized coordinates that then were used to locate the
nearest city to them, and their current weather conditions(at the time I had requested them). Next, I then made an interface which allows the user to put in their desired
temperature range, and then from the previously randomized locations, eliminates the locations outside the desired temperature range. At the end, I made a map of these
locations as well. Finally, in the third section, the itinerary was made to include 4 close locations off of the previously made map and then the itinerary is created to
include a travel via biking, driving and/or walking. An itinerary map and s smaller map with the hotels are included.
